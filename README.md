# QL City LAN Series — GitHub Pages bundle (v4)

- Fixed non-clickable links by using explicit `.html` links for internal pages.
- Clean schedule tables so they render properly.
- **Register page is now a form** that emails submissions via Formspree (replace the placeholder endpoint).
- Added **thank-you** page.

## Publish
