# QL City LAN Series — GitHub Pages bundle

**How to publish (web only):**
1. Create a GitHub repo (or open your existing one).
2. Delete `index.html` if it exists in the root.
3. Upload everything from this folder (keep the structure with the `assets/` directory).
4. Repo → **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** (`main` / root).
5. If using a custom domain, set it and enable **Enforce HTTPS**.
6. Visit your site. The logo is at `assets/logo.svg` — replace it with your own anytime.
